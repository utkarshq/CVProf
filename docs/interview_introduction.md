## 🎯 The 60-Second Pitch (Default)

> Use this as your go-to answer for *"Tell me about yourself."*

**Hi, I'm Utkarsh.** I'm an engineering student at FAU Erlangen with a strong focus on **software engineering** and **data analytics**.

Currently, I work as a **Student Assistant at the Fraunhofer IISB**, where I contribute to the EU project **AIMS50**. My work there revolves around building a **private Edge RAG solution on NVIDIA Jetson** for privacy-compliant analysis of industrial measurement data — combining LLMs, DevOps pipelines, and cloud infrastructure on Azure.

Before that, I gained hands-on experience as a **Software Engineer Intern at PLANIT//LEGAL** in Hamburg, where I built full-stack features with **Vue.js and Python**, and set up **Docker-based deployments** and automated testing with Pytest and Playwright. Prior to that, I spent over a year at **Hausfeld LLP** in Berlin working on data engineering, Power BI dashboards, and even designed a RAG solution workflow for their legal team.

What drives me is the intersection of **building reliable software** and **extracting value from data** — whether that means deploying ML pipelines, containerizing applications, or automating real-world workflows.

I'd love to bring that same hands-on, end-to-end engineering mindset to **[Company/Role]**.

## ⚡ The 30-Second Version (Elevator Pitch)

> For quick rounds, career fairs, or when they say *"briefly introduce yourself."*

I'm **Utkarsh**, an engineering student at FAU Erlangen. I currently work at **Fraunhofer IISB** on an EU-funded project, building **on-device AI solutions with NVIDIA Jetson** and cloud pipelines on Azure. I've previously built full-stack products at a legal-tech startup and automated data workflows at a major international law firm. My strengths are **Python, DevOps, and bridging data engineering with software development**.
